    reduction operator on torch.sparse.mm is ONLY implemented on CSR format on CPU.
    torch.sparse.mm() doesn't support computing derivaties with respect to CSR matrices.
        -> We could implement derivatives support for CSR matrices and reduction operator for CSR format on GPU.

    Sparse representation works well with graph adjacency matrices -> Maybe talk to prof Quattrociocchi

torch.sparse.addmm(mat, mat1, mat2, *, beta=1., alpha=1.) -> Tensor
    This function doesn't support computing derivaties with respect to CSR matrices.
